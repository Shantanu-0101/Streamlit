# Learn Streamlit with me.
This repository contains a structured learning path to master Streamlit using modern Python tools like uv. It starts from the basics and builds up to professional-level dashboards, using only core libraries such as Streamlit, pandas, and numpy.

You will learn how to build data apps, create interactive user interfaces, work with real datasets, and deploy your apps to the web — all from a single Python file per app.
